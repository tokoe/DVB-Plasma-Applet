Installation
-------------

To compile and install the dvb applet you need the developer
packages of KDE 4.2.X and Qt 4.Y (Y >= 4). Furthermore the
cmake application must be installed.

Do the following steps:

  tar -xjf dvb.tar.bz
  mkdir dvb.build
  cd dvb.build
  ccmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$KDEDIR ../dvb

    // inside ccmake type 'c' + <enter> twice and 'g' + <enter> once

  make
  su -c "make install"
  kbuildsycoca4
  kquitapp plasma
  plasma

Now everything should be installed and you can select the dvb applet
from the applet selection on the plasma desktop.
